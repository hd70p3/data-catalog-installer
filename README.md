# Installer for Engrafo Data Catalog Solution

**This repository holds a installation wizard for Engrafo Data Catalog Solution**

To install Engrafo Data Catalog Solution we have created an installer that has two 
installation options:

 1. Run Engrafo Data Catalog Solution in Docker 
 2. Set up a website,  database  and  the Engrafo Analyser Application on premises

Pull the project and make sure you run the project in administrator mode.
E.g. if you are using Visual Studion, then start Visial Studio in Administrator mode.

Option 1) requires that you have Docker Desktop Running. Can be run on any platform.

Option 2) requires a running Internet Information Server(IIS) and a MS SQL Server. (If you want to use the AI models in Engrafo, you need to use a 2025 MSSQL Server) 

If you need a ready-to-run installer you can download it here:
